# web-wallet

Nebulas wallet for the web. Nebulas users can use it to send transactions and submit smart contracts.

Nebulas already has a JavaScript library [neb.js](https://github.com/nebulasio/neb.js) that implements address generation, transaction signing, and submission. Web-wallet can be implemented using this library.

### TODO list

- generate nebulas address/account [done]
- send transaction (NAS & NRC20) [send NAS has done.]
- send offine transaction [done]
- view address/account info [done]
- view transaction status & info
- deploy/call smart contract
- choose nebulas network(Testnet, Mainnet etc.)


Thanks to @luoman for implementing a pre-version [naswallet](https://github.com/nebulasio/explorer/tree/master/nasWallet) for us.
